# Secured Student API

## Layer 1 — Foundation

- HTTPS + CORS Foundation
- Encrypted communication (TLS)
- Controlled browser access
- Safe data transport

*No security works without a safe connection.*

## Layer 2 - JWT Authentication

- Identity for every request
- Stateless authentication
- No anonymous access

*Now the API knows who you are.*

## Layer 3 - Role-Based Authorization

- Admin vs Student
- Restricted write operations
- Clear authority boundaries

*Not everyone can do everything.*

## Layer 4 - Ownership Policies

- User can access only his data
- Prevents horizontal privilege escalation
- Resource-level protection

*You can access only what belongs to you.*

## Layer 5 - Refresh Tokens & Logout

- Short-lived access tokens
- Long-lived secure sessions
- Token revocation

*Security without killing user experience.*

## Layer 6 - Rate Limiting

- Brute-force protection
- Abuse prevention
- System stability

*Security under attack conditions.*

## Layer 7 — Logging & Auditing

- Track security events
- Audit admin actions
- Detect suspicious behavior

*If you can’t see it, you can’t secure it.*
